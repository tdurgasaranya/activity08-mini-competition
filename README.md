Activity 08 - Classification Mini-Competition
================

This activity is intended to be completed in one week - two 75-minute
class meetings and outside of class work. Think of this as a
“culminating activity” for Module 3 (Classification).

In this repository/directory, you should see the following items:

- `README-img` - a folder containing images that I am embedding within
  this `README.md` file and other files. You do not need to do anything
  with this.
- `.gitignore` - a file that is used to specify what Git can ignore when
  pushing to GitHub. You do not need to do anything with this.
- `README.md` - the document you are currently reading.
- `competition-files` - a folder that contains items related to the
  mini-competition.

Before working on the mini-competition, you will first need to make your
own copy of this repository.

## Task 1: Forking & cloning

### Forking

Read these directions first, then work through them. In this GitHub repo
(i.e., my repo):

1.  Click on the ![fork](README-img/fork-icon.png) **Fork** icon near
    the upper-right-hand corner. You will be taken to a **Create a new
    fork** screen.
2.  Verify that your GitHub username is selected under **Owner** and
    that the **Repository name** is `activity08-mini-competition` with a
    green check mark (this verifies that you do not already have a
    GitHub repository with this name).
3.  You may provide a **Description** if you would like. This is a way
    to provide some additional, more descriptive, meta information
    related to the things you did. I like to provide a brief description
    of what happened.
4.  Verify that **Copy the `main` branch only** is selected.
5.  Click on the green **Create fork** button at the bottom of this
    page.

You should be taken a copy of this repo that is in your GitHub account.
That is, your page title should be
`username/activity08-mini-competition`, where `username` is replaced
with your GitHub username. Directly below this, you will see the
following message:

> forked from
> [gvsu-sta631/activity08-mini-competition](https://github.com/gvsu-sta631/activity08-mini-competition)

You will complete the rest of this activity in **your** forked copy of
the `activity08-mini-competition` repo.

### Cloning

Read these directions first, then work through them. Note that you will
be switching between RStudio and your GitHub repo (that you previously
forked).

1.  In RStudio, click on the
    <img src="README-img/rproj-icon.png" alt="RStudio Project" width = "20"/>
    icon (the icon below the Edit drop-down menu).
2.  Click on **Version Control** on the *New Project Wizard* pop-up.
3.  Click on **Git** and you should be on a “Clone Git Repository” page.
4.  Back to **your** `activity08-mini-competition` GitHub repo, click on
    the green **Code** button near the top of the page.
5.  Verify that **HTTPS** is underlined in orange/red on the drop-down
    menu, then copy the URL provided.
6.  Back in RStudio, paste the URL in the “Repository URL” text field.
7.  The “Project directory name” text field should have automatically
    populated with `activity08-mini-competition`. If yours did not (this
    is usually an issue on Macs),
    - Click back into the “Repository URL” text field.
    - Highlight any bit of this text (it does not seem to matter what or
      how much).
    - Press Ctrl/Cmd and the “Project directory name” should now have
      automatically populated with `activity08-mini-competition`.
8.  In the “Create project as subdirectory of” field, click on
    **Browse…**. Create a **New Folder** called “STA 631”, then within
    this folder, create a **New Folder** called “Activities”, then click
    **Choose**. If you already have this, you can simply browse to “STA
    631/Activities”, then click **Choose**. Note that I am forcing you
    to use my opinionated file system management style.
9.  Click on **Create Project**.

Your screen should refresh and the **Files** pane should say that you
are currently in your `activity08-mini-competition` folder that
currently has the same files and folders as your GitHub repo. If you are
asked for your GitHub credentials, provide your GitHub username and your
PAT (not your password).

There will not be a “Day 2” update to this repository.

## Task 2: The mini-competition

Read these directions first, then work through them.

1.  In your `activity08-mini-competition` repo folder/directory, locate
    and click into the `competition-files` subfolder.
2.  In the `competition-files` subfolder, you will be greeted by a new
    `README.md` file.
3.  Ask questions in class as you are working. Remember that you are
    working as a team (team rosters are posted in the **Week 6 (Feb 13)
    Tasks** document on Blackboard) to complete this mini-competition,
    including providing a two-slide presentation (more details in the
    `competition-files` subfolder). You will likely need to do some work
    between of our class meetings, remember that you can use our Teams
    workspace (linked on Blackboard), and post questions/issues in the
    **Muddy** channel or send direct messages to your team members. If
    someone else already posted what you though was muddy, add any
    clarification to their post and give them a “+ 1” 👍. Remember that
    this space is for conversations as well as posting questions. Read
    through your peers’ muddy posts and do your best to provide help.
